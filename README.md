# Projects
This repository contains many of the projects that I have worked on:

# 1- Research Design: The Uber Case
Uber, renowned for its disruptive ride-hailing service, is at the forefront of transforming transportation globally.
The company's innovative approach includes a two-way rating system between Uber Riders and Drivers embedded in their mobile app.
Our research seeks to investigate the impact of discounts on customer satisfaction by conducting an experiment where Uber riders are randomly assigned to receive a 25% discount, aiming to ascertain whether price plays a significant role in determining customer service ratings.
This quantitative study aims to shed light on the interplay between pricing and customer satisfaction in the context of Uber's services.

# 2- Kaggle Competition: AirBnB
To enhance Airbnb's revenue strategies, I propose refining our analytical methods for more precise predictions, focusing on predicting property retail prices to impact profits and sales. 
Through extensive data prediction, exploration, and model development, I achieved an optimal Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of ~325 using the ranger model. 
For a detailed understanding of the model, please refer to the accompanying R code file.


# 3- Storytelling: Ollie's Bargain Case
Ollie's plans to celebrate its 40th anniversary in 2022 by expanding its reach and offerings, with a strategic entry into the digital market through "Ollieâ€™s Online." 
This initiative aims to leverage competitors' sales data analysis across categories like clothing, electronics, and food to identify trends, enabling a successful expansion, increased sales, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

# 4- Managing Data: Recipe Generator
Our nutrition-focused web application addresses the growing importance of a healthy lifestyle, heightened by the pandemic. 
Recognizing the challenges of time constraints, food allergies, and dietary restrictions, we aim to tap into the expanding personalized nutrition market by offering a convenient recipe generator that accommodates individual preferences and available ingredients, transforming home cooking into an effortless experience.
